# React Client App Boilerplate

Boilerplate for developing and building a strictly client-side React app. The build process generates static files, but this repo contains no server-side application to serve them in production.

First, install the dependencies:

`$ npm install`

For development, use

`$ npm run start`

To build the static files, use

`$ npm run build`

The static files end up in the build directory.
